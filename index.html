          <h1>What if education could survive any storm?</h1>
          <p>After 20 years building software and 15 years building houses, I learned something crucial: the strongest structures are the ones that bend without breaking. Every mind works differently, every community has unique needs. Now I build education systems the same way‚Äîflexible enough for all learners, strong enough to survive any storm.</p>

          <h2>From Technologist to Climate Innovator</h2>
          <p><strong>I started as a technologist, became a carpenter, then an educationalist. Now I'm building climate resilience.</strong> After 20+ years developing digital systems, 15+ years in construction, and 5 years teaching, I have the skills needed‚Äîbut climate change threatens everything we're trying to build.</p>
          <p>My approach: start with what I can deliver immediately (construction education), build community trust, then scale to bigger challenges. Construction training ‚Üí biodiversity preservation ‚Üí autonomous technology. Each phase funds the next.</p>

        <h2>Why Climate Change Changes Everything</h2>

            <h3>The Climate Reality</h3>
            <p>Pacific communities face accelerating threats that traditional education systems can't survive. When disaster strikes, all educational progress stops. We need learning systems that get stronger during emergencies, not weaker.</p>
            
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Traditional education systems fail during climate disasters</li>
              <li>Communities lose 2-3 months of learning during disaster recovery</li>

        <div class="faq-grid">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why these specific funding amounts?</h3>
            <p><strong>$500 Phase 1:</strong> Covers curriculum development, pilot delivery, and impact documentation for construction education. <strong>$1,500 Phase 2:</strong> Adds community partnership development and seed banking infrastructure. <strong>$5,000 Phase 3:</strong> Funds autonomous vessel prototype development and testing. Each phase builds credibility for the next.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I know this will actually work?</h3>
            <p>You don't‚Äîthat's why we start small. Phase 1 leverages my proven 15+ years construction experience and 5 years teaching background. Success creates the credibility and community trust needed for Phases 2 and 3. If Phase 1 fails, you've invested in proven skills, not empty promises.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why not fund established climate NGOs instead?</h3>
            <p>Established NGOs are essential, but they rarely combine construction expertise, technology development, and community education in one integrated approach. Most focus on either advocacy OR direct service. I'm filling a specific gap: climate-resilient education systems that communities control and operate.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if the technology doesn't work out?</h3>
            <p>Phase 1 (construction education) delivers value regardless of later phases. Phase 2 (biodiversity preservation) works even without autonomous vessels. Each phase creates standalone value while building toward the integrated vision. You're funding progression, not all-or-nothing innovation.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do you ensure community control vs technology colonialism?</h3>
            <p>Everything is open-source. Communities see, modify, and own the technology. My teaching experience with MƒÅori learners and neurodiverse students proves I understand "listen first, co-create locally." No technology gets deployed without community leadership deciding how it's used.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's your timeline for each phase?</h3>
            <p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> 0-12 months for construction education curriculum and pilot delivery. <strong>Phase 2:</strong> 12-24 months for community partnerships and seed banking. <strong>Phase 3:</strong> 24+ months for autonomous vessel development and testing. Phases can overlap based on community readiness and funding availability.</p>
